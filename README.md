# Project Stargazer: Using Autoencoders to Visualize Real Estate Markets
## Real-Estate Markets
Real-estate markets consist of goods that are feature rich and complex that make large-scale comparisons and understanding difficult. Some of the features are easy to compare (e.g., 2 bedroom vs. 3), but others are categorical (e.g., neighborhood, house vs. condo). Most vexing of all is aligning combinations of features. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show a list of features found in conveyances and parcel data published by Hillsborough County.
